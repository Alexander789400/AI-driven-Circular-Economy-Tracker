# ♻️ AI Driven Circular Economy Tracker  
### Predicting Recycled Material Usage & Detecting High-Waste Events with Machine Learning

This project applies **AI and data-driven analytics** to track and optimize **circular economy performance** in industrial facilities.  
Using historical operations data, the system predicts:

- **Regression:** `recycled_material_kg` → Amount of recycled material used per day  
- **Classification:** `high_waste_flag` → Binary indicator of unusually high waste events  

The goal is to help organizations **reduce waste**, **increase resource recovery**, and **move toward sustainable manufacturing**.
